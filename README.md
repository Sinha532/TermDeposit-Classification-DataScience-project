# Client Subscription Classification Project

I worked on a classification project aimed at predicting whether clients would subscribe to a term deposit. The highest accuracy I achieved was with the **Decision Tree**, reaching an impressive 90% accuracy score.

## 🔍 Project Overview:
The project's goal was to develop machine learning models capable of accurately predicting client subscriptions based on various features. To achieve this, I:
- Thoroughly explored the provided dataset to understand the underlying patterns.
- Created and fine-tuned multiple classification models.
- Evaluated model performance to ensure robust and reliable predictions.

## 🛠 Technologies and Techniques:
Throughout this project, I leveraged several key tools and methodologies, including:

- **Data Visualization:** Utilizing libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to uncover insights from the data.
- **Model Development:** Building and evaluating models using techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Prediction and Evaluation:** Making predictions on test datasets and using performance metrics to validate model accuracy.

## 📂 Repository Structure:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with the code for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- `results/`: Outputs and results from the model evaluations.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## 🚀 Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-link>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd client-subscription-classification`
3. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks to see the data exploration and model development process.
